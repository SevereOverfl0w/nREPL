## Middlewares

Here's a list of notable nREPL middleware you might encounter in the wild.

[WARNING]
====
    Make sure you're using the latest versions of those middlewares, as
    all of them added support for nREPL 0.4+ fairly recently.
====
### Clojure Editor Support

* [cider-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl): A collection of nREPL middleware designed to enhance CIDER (and Clojure editors in general).
* [refactor-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl): A collection of functionality designed to support editor refactoring features.
* [sayid](http://bpiel.github.io/sayid/): A powerful tracing/debugging tool. It is a great alternative of CIDER-nREPL's
basic tracing functionality.

###  ClojureScript support to nREPL session

* [Piggieback](https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback)

The following ClojureScript REPLs are leveraging piggieback internally to provide
nREPL support.

* [Weasel](https://github.com/tomjakubowski/weasel)
* [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)
* [figwheel-main](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main)
* [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) (it actually
only stubs the piggieback API, leverages its own nREPL middleware
internally for ClojureScript evaluation)

### HTTP support

* [drawbridge](https://github.com/nrepl/drawbridge)

### Deprecated Middleware

This section lists middlewares that were somewhat prominent in the
past, but were replaced by alternatives down the road.

* [nrepl-middleware](https://github.com/pallet/ritz/tree/develop/nrepl-middleware),
  part of [ritz](https://github.com/pallet/ritz) that provides a
  variety of nREPL middleware supporting various enhanced REPL
  operations (including apropos, javadoc lookup, code completion, and
  an alternative eval implementation). **(superseded by `cider-nrepl`)**
* [Javert](https://github.com/technomancy/javert) provides a basic
  object inspector. **(superseded by `cider-nrepl`)**
* [nrepl-profile](https://github.com/thunknyc/nrepl-profile): profiling middleware,
which was eventually integrated into `cider-nrepl`.

    This list doesn't aim to be complete. You can find more 3rd-party middlewares listed
