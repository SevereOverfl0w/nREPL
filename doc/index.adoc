## Overview

nREPL is a Clojure network REPL that provides a REPL server and
client, along with some common APIs of use to IDEs and other tools
that may need to evaluate Clojure code in remote environments.

## Why nREPL?

nREPL has been designed with the aim of ensuring that it satisfies the
requirements of both application developers (in support of activities ranging
from interactive remote debugging and experimentation in development
contexts through to more advanced use cases such as updating deployed
applications) as well as toolmakers (providing a standard way to connect to and
introspect running environments as a way of informing user interfaces of all
kinds, including "standard" interactive, text-based REPLs).

The default network protocol used is simple, depending neither
on JVM or Clojure specifics, thereby allowing (encouraging?) the development
of non-Clojure REPL clients.  The REPLs operational semantics are such
that essentially any non-JVM Clojure implementation should be able to
implement it, with allowances for hosts that lack the concurrency primitives to
support e.g. asynchronous evaluation, interrupts, etc.
